    <string name="aditya_asthana">Hello, I am Aditya, the creator of <b>Food Owl</b>, a hyperlocal late night food delivery service that is yet to be launched. I also founded <b>Project Macht </b>
        <i>(https://www.projectmacht.xyz).</i>
        I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at LNCT Bhopal. I am a Computer Science Enthusiast. I am skilled in Android Development and Machine Learning.  </string>
    <string name="journey">Food Owl was conceptualized in a hostel room, Bhopal by Aditya Asthana. The idea struck when Asthana, along with his mates found themselves hungry in the middle of a night 03:00 AM in the morning.
    The traditional FnB applications presented some late night restaurants open, but the final prices were sky rocket. This was the moment, when he realised, the need for late night food services in the community.
    Since then, it is a journey. We are here in our testing phase of the prototype.</string>
    <string name="foodowl_about">
        We are a "Conceptualizing" Project, that deals in FnB Industry and specifically target late night food hunger and cravings. This application is currently in development and is available for testing purposes. The application
        has Payments enabled in testing mode and hence, no money will be deducted. We are living in 21st century where we witness different lifestyles. One of the trending lifestyle is the night lifestyle where creative minds
        are awake in the night being productive or maybe just chilling. But the experience is worsened when the hunger strikes! This gives birth to our concept of late night food delivery service, where we aim to stop
        the hunger from killing the creativity of our costumers.
